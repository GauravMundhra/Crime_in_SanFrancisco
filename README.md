# Choropleth-map
Creation of choropleth maps in Python. 
In this visualization project in Python, I used Folium library, the GeoJSON file of world countries and a publicly available dataset for crime rates in San Francisco and visualized it on SF's map.
The project is part of the final assignment for IBM's "Data Visualization by Python" course on Coursera:
